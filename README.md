# Elden Ring Compendium

I started this project due to my love for the video game Elden Ring. From the beginning, I decided to forgo the use of any frameworks and instead decided to test my DOM manipulation abilites through vanilla Javascript. The Elden Ring Compendium compiles data for various categories related to the game. Through the use of the Elden Ring Fan API, the user is able to input their query to the search bar or use the pagination to scan through the results of their selected category.
